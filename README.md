LLM Evaluation Platform for Creative Writing Quality
A research-grade web application for benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on creative writing tasks, using multi-metric evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge scoring.


## 🔍 Overview
### Creative Writing Benchmark allows users to:
. Compare multiple LLMs on the same creative prompt
. Automatically evaluate outputs using a judge model
### . Score models on:
    . Theme Coherence
    . Creativity
    . Fluency
    . Engagement
. Visualize results through charts and leaderboards
. Run in Demo Mode (no API credits required) or Live Mode (OpenRouter / LiteLLM)

### This project is suitable for:
. Research demos
. Model comparison studies
. Product evaluation
. Client presentations


## Key Features
. Multi-model benchmarking (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Moonshot, etc.)
. LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation pipeline
. Multi-metric scoring (0–40 total score)
. Visual analytics (charts & leaderboard)
. Demo / Preview mode (no API billing required)
. Deployed on Render (production-ready)

🔑 Environment Variables
Configure the following in Render → Environment or a local .env file.
Required (Live Mode)
LITELLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
LITELLM_API_KEY=sk-or-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Optional (Demo Mode)
MOCK_MODE=true
When MOCK_MODE=true, the app renders charts and scores without calling external APIs — perfect for demos when credits are unavailable.
🚀 Running Locally
npm install
npm run build
npm start
App will run on:
http://localhost:10000
🌍 Production Deployment
Hosted on Render
Auto-deploys on main branch push
Uses Node.js + static Vite build
To redeploy:
git push origin main
🧪 Demo vs Live Mode
Mode	Description
Demo Mode	Visual demo with mock scores (no billing)
Live Mode	Real API calls using OpenRouter / LiteLLM
Switch modes via environment variables — no code changes required.
📊 Evaluation Metrics
Each model output is scored on:
Metric	Range
Theme Coherence	0–10
Creativity	0–10
Fluency	0–10
Engagement	0–10
Total Score	0–40
🧾 API Endpoint
POST /api/benchmark
Request
{

    }
  ]
}
📌 Notes for Client
If results do not appear:
Check API credits
Verify LITELLM_API_KEY
Use Demo Mode for preview
Model availability depends on OpenRouter account permissions
